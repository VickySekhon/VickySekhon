## Projects:

### [Sorting Algorithm Visualizer](https://github.com/VickySekhon/SortingAlgorithmVisualizer)

##### Python | Tkinter

**Project Overview:** Sorting Algorithm Visualizer features 6 algorithms: Shell Sort, Merge Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, and Bubble Sort. It is built using Python and Tkinter for the GUI. The objective was to visually represent various sorting algorithms, allowing users to understand and observe how each algorithm works.  
  
**Personal Experience:** This was an enjoyable project I worked on for a week. I spent most of my time understanding the implementation of the selected algorithms, using pen and paper to visualize the sorting process. Then I implemented all of the algorithms in the code. Afterward, I found Tkinter and eventually tinkered around to create the visualization part of the project.

### [Dorm Direct](https://github.com/VickySekhon/DormDirect)

##### React | Flask | Firebase | Node.js | TypeScript | Python

**Project Overview:** DormDirect uses a BeautifulSoup Web Scrapper to scrape listings from 3 popular listing searches on Kijiji (1 => "Student housing Waterloo", 2 => "Wilfrid Laurier University housing", 3 => "University of Waterloo housing"). Once the listings are scrapped, they are contained within a Flask backend that JSONifies the fetched listing information and makes it available at an API endpoint. The React frontend retrieves the JSONified listing content from the endpoint and displays it in a clean way.  
  
**Personal Experience:** Navigating between schoolwork, tuition fees, and internships is already difficult enough for university students. Looking for Housing becomes strenuous, especially between work and school terms. That's why I felt the need to build DormDirect to streamline the process of finding listings for university students in Waterloo. All of us are Co-op students which means we're constantly looking for housing between work terms and we thought to build a platform that will help us do this.

### [NoteEase](https://github.com/VickySekhon/NoteEase)

##### Tensor Flow | Google Cloud | Google Gemini | MongoDB | React | Express | Node.js

**Project Overview:** Note Ease allows students the flexibility to listen to their Professors while having AI assist them in retaining lecture content by developing a summarized transcript of key lecture material. During the development of the transcript the user has the opportunity to format the notes to their liking by using TensorFlow object detection to signify the need for a new bullet point.  
  
**Personal Experience:** Overall, my team and I learned how to use the MERN stack to develop a web application. This was a hackathon project where we won Best Use of AI in Education at GDSC Hacks 2024.

### [My LeetCodes](https://github.com/VickySekhon/neetcode-roadmap)

##### Python | Java | TypeScript

**Project Overview:** Learning DSAs is extremely important to become a good developer, as many coding interviews nowadays often assess a candidate's technical ability through the extent to which they can solve LeetCode Styled questions.  
  
**Personal Experience:** As someone who enjoys programming, I love coding and by regularly solving questions, I have been able to sharpen my technical abilities. For example, although Python is the language I am most comfortable with, by using Python to solve a variety of questions, I have used countless built-in Python functionalities I did not know about. I think this is an extremely effective way of developing an understanding of a programming language, while simultaneously learning fundamental DSAs.

### [YouTube Clone](https://vickysekhon.github.io/YouTubeClone/)

##### HTML | CSS

**Project Overview:** Created a front-end personalized clone of YouTube inspired by the settings I use for the software. Interacted with Chrome Dev Tools to accurately represent software design elements. Created working links to YouTube videos.  
  
**Personal Experience:** This was an enjoyable project I worked on over 2 weeks. I learned fundamental HTML elements and have become familiar with advanced CSS design elements to the extent that I am confident in my abilities to use HTML and CSS for static web development.

### [Voiceover Prompt](https://vickysekhon.github.io/VoiceoverPrompt/)

##### HTML | CSS | JavaScript

**Project Overview:** Created a webpage where consumers can type text and click a button to hear it read to them. Includes volume, speech tempo, and voice accent customizability. Features a word count with remaining characters displayed to the user. Uses local storage to store inputted text inside the browser's cache.  
  
**Personal Experience:** This project allowed me to learn fundamental data skills as I accessed user information by using local storage to save a user's data. In addition to this, I am happy with the styling and minimalistic appearance of the webpage; it is one of my favorite projects.

### [Restaurant Simulator](https://github.com/VickySekhon/Restaurant-Simulator)

##### Java

**Project Overview:** This restaurant simulator allows a user to create a custom menu and interact with it using an intuitive GUI from which they can print out a physical receipt. To implement this GUI, the project leverages Java's abstract classes and inheritance functionality to create a Java JFrame, by calling independent classes to create functionality as well as a PrinterJob API to invoke the Windows OS printing system.  
  
**Personal Experience:** As part of my final project for CP213 (Object-Oriented Programming), I wanted to utilize my skills in Java and create a GUI project.
