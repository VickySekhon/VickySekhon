  <h3>YouTube Clone</h3>
  <h5 style = "margin-bottom: 0px;">HTML | CSS</h5>
  <div>
    <p style = "width: 390px; display: inline-block; vertical-align: middle;"><strong>Project Overview:</strong>
      Created a front-end personalized clone of YouTube inspired by the settings I use for the software. Interacted with Chrome Dev Tools to accurately represent software design elements. Created working links to YouTube videos. 
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Personal Experience:</strong>
      This was an extremely fun project I worked on over the course of 2 weeks. I learned fundamental HTML elements and have become familiar with advanced CSS design elements to the extent that I am confident in my abilities to use HTML and CSS for website development.

  <h5 style = "margin-bottom: 0px;">HTML | CSS | JavaScript</h5>
  <div>
    <p style = "width: 390px; display: inline-block; vertical-align: middle;"><strong>Project Overview:</strong>
Created a webpage where consumers can type text and click a button to hear it read to them. Includes volume, speech tempo, and voice accent customizability. Features a word count with remaining characters displayed to the user. Uses local storage to store inputted text inside the browser's cache.  
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Personal Experience:</strong>
This project allowed me to learn fundamental data skills as I accessed user information by using local storage to save a user's data. In addition to this, I am happy with the styling and minimalistic appearance of the webpage, it is one of my favourite projects.

  <h3>Runner</h3>
  <h5 style = "margin-bottom: 0px;">Python | Pygame</h5>
  <div>
    <p style = "width: 390px; display: inline-block; vertical-align: middle;"><strong>Project Overview:</strong>
      Created a Full-stack 2D video game using the Pygame Python library. The game involves the use of basic math and physics for the character’s movement and to keep the character within the bounds of the screen. The use of visual design elements along with audio makes the game a simple yet appealing 2D Python Game.
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Personal Experience:</strong>
      This project was very rewarding because I used all the code interactively. I especially enjoyed the backend of this project and was surprised at the math involved in moving the character forward. Overall, I learned how to use Pygame for game development and this project contributed to my knowledge of Python outside of data structures and sorting algorithms.
