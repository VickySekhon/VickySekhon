      <p class="project-description">
        <strong>Project Overview:</strong>
        This project is a Sorting Algorithm Visualizer built using Python and
        the Tkinter library. It provides a graphical representation of various
        sorting algorithms, allowing users to observe and understand how each
        algorithm works.
        <br /><br />
        <strong>Personal Experience:</strong>
        This was an enjoyable project I worked on over one week. I spent most
        of my time understanding the implementation of the selected
        algorithms, using pen and paper to visualize the sorting process. I
        then implemented all of the algorithms in the code. I then learned and
        got some help using Tkinter and eventually created the visualization
        tool.

    </h5>
    <div>
      <p class="project-description">
        <strong>Project Overview:</strong>
        DormDirect uses a BeautifulSoup Web Scrapper to scrape listings from 3
        popular listing searches on Kijiji (1 => "Student housing waterloo", 2
        => "Wilfrid Laurier University housing", 3 => "University of Waterloo
        housing"). Once the listings are scrapped, they are contained within a
        Flask backend that Jsonifies the fetched listing information and makes
        it available at an API endpoint. The React frontend retrieves the
        jsonified listing content from the endpoint and displays it in a clean
        way.
        <br /><br />
        <strong>Personal Experience:</strong>
        Navigating between schoolwork, tuition fees, and internships is
        already difficult enough for university students. Looking for housing
        becomes strenuous, especially between work and school terms. That's
        why I felt the need to build DormDirect to streamline the process of
        finding listings for university students in Waterloo. All of us are
        Co-op students which means we're constantly looking for housing
        between work terms and we thought to build a platform that will help
        us do this.

          <strong>Project Overview:</strong>
          Note Ease allows students the flexibility to listen to their profs

          develop a transcript. During the developing of the transcript the user
          has the opportunity to format the notes to their liking by using
          Tensor Flow embedded into the website which tracks the students hand
          movement to add the indentation or the bullet point of the students
          choosing rather than manually type it out
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Personal Experience:</strong>
          Overall, my team and I  learned how to properly use the MERN stack to
          develop a web application and how to use react in terms of syntax both
          front end and back end. We've also been able to successfully use API
          with the help of Google Cloud, and further learned what TensorFlow is
          used for and embedded it on our site.

          <strong>Project Overview:</strong>
          Learning DSAs is extremely important to become a good developer, as many 
          coding interviews nowadays often assess a candidate's technical ability
          through the extent to which they can solve LeetCode Styled questions.  
          <br /><br />
          <strong>Personal Experience:</strong>
          As someone who enjoys programming, I love coding and by regularly solving 
          questions, I have been able to sharpen my technical abilities. For example, 
          although Python is the language I am most comfortable with, by using Python to solve a variety 
          of questions, I have used countless built-in Python functionalities I did not know about. 
          I think this is an extremely effective way of developing an understanding of a 
          programming language, while simultaneously learning fundamnetal DSAs.

        This restaurant simulator allows a user to create a custom menu and

        a physical receipt. To implement this GUI, the project leverages
        Java's abstract classes and inheritance functionality to create a Java
        JFrame, by calling independent classes to create functionality as well
        as a PrinterJob API to invoke the Windows OS printing system.
